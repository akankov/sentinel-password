# Security Policy

The security of Sentinel Password and its users is a top priority. We appreciate responsible disclosures from the community and aim to respond promptly and transparently.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the latest published version of the `@sentinel-password/core` package.

If you are using an older version, we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest release to benefit from the most recent security fixes and hardening.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Contact the maintainers privately at:
   - **Email:** `akankov@gmail.com`
3. Provide as much detail as possible, including:
   - A description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any relevant code snippets, logs, or proof-of-concept

Please avoid including any real passwords, API keys, or other sensitive data in your report.

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your report as soon as reasonably possible.
- We will investigate the issue and work to reproduce it.
- Once confirmed, we will:
  - Assess the severity and impact
  - Prepare a fix or mitigation
  - Plan a coordinated disclosure, if applicable

We may contact you for additional information and to coordinate public disclosure once a fix is available.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and remediate the issue before publicly disclosing it.
- Avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or disrupting production systems while investigating.
- Comply with applicable laws and avoid accessing data that does not belong to you.

## Out of Scope

The following are generally out of scope for this security policy:

- Issues requiring physical access to a device
- Social engineering attacks

If you are unsure whether something is in scope, you can still reach out privately and we will let you know.
